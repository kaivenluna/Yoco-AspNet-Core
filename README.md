# Yoco-AspNet-Core

This project is to solve an issue which is that Yoco.co.za does not have a asp.net core libary that is usable in C# projects.

By introducing a Yoco payment service that can be called and pull your data into and to offer payment services via an intergration of Yoco, while offering a full service that also recive webhook events that keep a record that one can compare against.

Version Update, yoco has finally added a way on listing all the webhooks and being able to delete any unused webhooks, which means finally this service will be avaliable soon.
